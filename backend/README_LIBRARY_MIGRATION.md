# Library Attendance API Migration

This document describes the migration of the library attendance API from a Flask-based proxy service to an integrated Node.js implementation.

## Overview

The original implementation used a Flask application hosted at `https://libman.ethiccode.in.net` that acted as a proxy to the SIES GST library attendance system. This Flask application:

1. Authenticated with the library system
2. Scraped HTML data
3. Cached responses
4. Provided a RESTful API

The new implementation integrates this functionality directly into our Node.js backend, eliminating the need for a separate service.

## Implementation Details

### New Files

- `backend/services/libraryAttendanceService.js` - Core service that handles authentication, HTML parsing, and caching
- `backend/routes/libraryAttendanceRoutes.js` - Express routes that expose the API endpoints

### Dependencies

- `cheerio` - For HTML parsing (equivalent to BeautifulSoup in Python)

### API Endpoints

All endpoints are now available under `/api/library/` instead of `/altapi/`:

- GET `/api/library/last_entry` - Get the last person who entered the library
- GET `/api/library/list_all` - List all students currently in the library
- GET `/api/library/todays_footfall` - Get today's footfall count
- GET `/api/library/total_footfall` - Get total footfall count
- GET `/api/library/dashboard` - Get all dashboard data in one request
- GET `/api/library/health` - Health check endpoint
- POST `/api/library/cache/clear` - Clear the cache
- POST `/api/library/in_out` - Perform IN/OUT action

### Authentication

API key authentication is still required. The API key should be provided in the `XApiKey` or `X-API-KEY` header.

## Frontend Changes

The frontend has been updated to use the new API endpoints:

- Updated `LibraryManage/src/utils/apiConfig.js` to use `/api/library/` instead of `/altapi/`
- Removed `/altapi` proxy from `LibraryManage/vite.config.js`

## Benefits of Migration

1. **Unified Codebase**: Single technology stack (Node.js) for easier maintenance
2. **Reduced Latency**: Eliminating the additional hop to the Flask service
3. **Better Integration**: Direct access to MongoDB for potential future enhancements
4. **Simplified Authentication**: Uses the same authentication system as the rest of the API
5. **Cost Reduction**: No need to maintain a separate Python server

## Testing

To test the new implementation:

1. Start the Node.js server: `cd backend && npm start`
2. Start the frontend: `cd LibraryManage && npm run dev`
3. Test the library attendance features in the application

## Rollback Plan

If issues are encountered:

1. Revert the changes to `LibraryManage/src/utils/apiConfig.js`
2. Restore the `/altapi` proxy in `LibraryManage/vite.config.js`
3. Ensure the Flask service is still running at `https://libman.ethiccode.in.net`

## Future Improvements

1. Implement more robust error handling
2. Add more comprehensive logging
3. Consider using MongoDB for caching instead of in-memory cache
4. Add unit tests for the new service
